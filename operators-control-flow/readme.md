1. List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators

- Arithmetic Operators
   - Ans: Addition: '+'  
     Subtraction: '-'  
     Multiplication: '\*'  
     Division: '/'  
     Modulus (remainder): '%'  
     Exponentiation: '\*\*'

- Assignment Operators
   - Ans: '=' (equal to)  
    '+=' (add and assign)  
    '-=' (subtract and assign)  
    '\*=' (multiply and assign)  
    '/=' (divide and assign)  
    '%=' (modulus and assign)

- Comparison Operators
   - Ans: Loose equal to: '=='  
     Not equal to: '!='  
     Strict equal to: '==='  
     Strict not equal to: '!=='  
     Greater than: '>'  
     Greater than or equal to: '>='  
     Less than: '<'  
     Less than or equal to: '<='

- Logical Operators
  - Ans: && (logical AND)  
    || (logical OR)  
    ! (logical NOT)

- Bitwise Operators
  - Ans: & (Bitwise AND)  
    | (Bitwise OR)  
    ^ (Bitwise XOR)  
    ~ (Bitwise NOT)  
    << (Bitwise left shift)

2. For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.

- Assignment Operators:  
  Example 1: let x = 10;  
  Example 2: let y = "hello";  
- Arithmetic Operators:  
  Example 1: const sum = 5 + 10;  
  Example 2: const division = 20 / 4;  
- Comparison Operators:  
  Example 1: let x = 5;  
  let y = 10;  
  if (x < y) {  
  console.log("x is less than y");  
  }  
  Example 2: let a = "hello";  
  let b = "world";  
  if (a != b) {  
  console.log("a and b are not equal");  
  }  
- Logical Operators:  
  Example 1: let x = 5;  
  let y = 10;  
  if (x < y && x != 0) {  
  console.log("Both conditions are true");  
  }  
  Example 2: let a = "hello";  
  let b = "";  
  if (a && b) {  
  console.log("Both strings are not empty");  
  }  
- Bitwise Operators:  
  Example 1: let i = 5 & 1;  
  Example 2: let j = 10 | 5;  

3. The result when the progarm is executed is:  
   1  
   8  
   15
